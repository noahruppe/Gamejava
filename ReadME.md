# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{This software is a RPG game it allows you to make decisions. And your decisions effect the outcome of the game.}

{I wrote this software so that I could become more comfortable with classes and constructors. And to be able to use the java language more comfortably. This is the first time I have used this language and this has taught me so much!}

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I would like to fix the clean the files up a little I got started on one thing and didn't like it so I just commented it out.
so I would like to clean that up.


- I would like to also manage my files better everything is just scatterd and not organized which made it hard to remember where things were.



- I would like to implement more things, more of the story more fights. But just didn't have enough time so I would like to improve this and make it better.
